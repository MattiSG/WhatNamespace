WhatNamespace.net
=================

A [repository of XML dialects/vocabularies](http://whatnamespace.net) and their associated namespaces for semantic web students.


Rationale
---------

If you're generating data for the [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) and expecting it to become [linked data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_Data), you should reuse existing vocabularies and ontologies as often as you can.

The primary goal of WhatNamespace is to make it extremely fast to reuse namespaces you may already know about.

Its secondary goal is to make it easy to find new vocabularies for specific use-cases.


Features
--------

- Available offline: load once, use anywhere with immediate access.
- Mobile-friendly. Combine with the above to have a perfect companion.
- Autoselect on hover for fast copying.
- Link to spec.
- Single page to allow for in-page search.


Limitations
-----------

WhatNamespace is a nice tool mainly thanks to its GUI. It is very good if you have to write some semantic documents by hand and don’t want to look up every single vocabulary’s namespace as it becomes needed.

However, the advent of much more complete solutions for both goals stopped its development for more complex use-cases than learning the semantic web technologies. See below for more information.


Alternatives
------------

- [prefix.cc](http://prefix.cc) is much more feature-full than WhatNamespace as a repository of namespaces, and offers many more output formats. I simply didn't know about it when I built WN  ;)  The only advantage of WhatNamespace is to be full-page, so you can `⌘-F` if you don’t remember the exact name of a dialect.
- [LOV](http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/) is much more complete than WhatNamespace as a repository of dialects. It simply didn't exist when I built WN  :)
